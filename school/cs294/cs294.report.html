This is an implementation of a water temperature and flow controller for use in shower and
sinks.  The domain of facts considered are flow and temperature and the domain of actions that
corresponds to these are control actions to achieve a given goal.  A rule base is formed using
these facts and control actions.  This rule base is evaluated using the actual fuzzified goal
computed with the existing conditions.  Applicable rules are filed and a conclusion is drawn. 
The max-prod method is used to scale the conclusion and the mean of maxima method is used
for defuzzification.  The fuzzy system is able to achieve a specified temperature and flow in
most cases.<HR>

<P><B><A NAME="Introduction">1.0 Introduction</A></B></P>
<P>In the real world much of the knowledge is "fuzzy knowledge".  Human thinking and reasoning
frequently involves processing this fuzzy knowledge and formulating responses.  When the
boundary of a piece of information is not clear cut, the result is fuzzy knowledge.  For example,
consider the concept of hot vs the concept of cold.  There is no temperature at which something
goes from being cold to being hot.  To some people hot is about 65 F, to others it is cold. 
Clearly, if the temperature is about 32 F it is cold, and if it is 100 F it is hot.  It is easy to
distinguish these to regimes at the extremes, but values in between them have some potential
of being both hot and cold, depending on the context.<P>

This kind of information cannot be represented by classical set theory, because it only deals
with objects whose membership to a set can be clearly defined.  It needs to be represented
using the concept of fuzzy set theory, in which the membership of an element to a set can be
partial.  The level to which an object belongs to a fuzzy set is called grade of membership of
that element in that fuzzy set.  Formally, a fuzzy set A in a universe of discourse U is
characterized by a membership function <A HREF="cs294.report.html#endnote1">[1]</A>:<P>

<CENTER>&#181;A : U --> [0,1]<P></CENTER>

which associates with each element x of U a number &#181;A(x) in the interval [0,1] which
represents the grade of membership of x in the fuzzy set A.  Sometimes fuzzy sets are
referred to as fuzzy terms.<P>

Several fuzzy terms are associated with a fuzzy variable.  These fuzzy terms defines the set
of values that a fuzzy variables may take.  For example, this project uses the fuzzy terms
{cold,warm,hot} to describe water temperature.  Each of these terms represents a specific
fuzzy set.<P>

Sometimes fuzzy sets which are dealt with are classified as "increasing", "decreasing" and
"approximating" <A HREF="cs294.report.html#endnote2">[2]</A>.  In this project an increasing 
fuzzy set (function) is used to represent the concept of hot on the domain of temperature, 
while a decreasing fuzzy set is used to represent the concept of cold.  An approximating 
fuzzy set is used to describe warm temperatures.<P>

Fuzzy control also uses linguistic notions that are meaning-independent of the particular
physical domain.  The most common domain in fuzzy control consists of seven elements, which
have domain names like "Positive Big" (PB), "Positive Medium" (PM), "Positive Small" (PS),
"Zero" (ZR), "Negative Small" (NS), "Negative Medium" (NM) and "Negative Big" (NB).  The
domain used to describe these is usually between [-6,6], which is called the "Standard"
domain.  Sometimes the domain [-1,1] is used, in which case the domain is called "Normal" 
<A HREF="cs294.report.html#endnote3">[3]</A>.<P>

<B><A NAME="FuzzyFunctions">1.1 Fuzzy Functions</A></B><P>
The fuzzy functions that are implemented in this project for describing the physical
temperature domain are the "S", the "Z" and the "PI" functions.  Mathematically these are
defined as:<P>

<CENTER><TABLE>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
	<TD>S function:</TD>
	<TD>S(u,a,c) = 0,<i> u < a</i><BR>
		S(u,a,c) = 2[(u-a)/(c-a)]**2, <i>a < u < (a+c)/2</i><BR>
		S(u,a,c) = 1 - 2[(u-c)/(c-a)]**2, <i>(a+c)/2 < u < c</i><BR>
		S(u,a,c) = 1, <i>u > c</i></TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD>Z function:</TD><TD>Z(u,a,c) = 1 - S(u,a,c)</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
	<TD>PI function:</TD>
	<TD>PI(u,a,c) = S(u,a,(a+c)/2), <i>u > (a+c)/2</i><BR>
		PI(u,a,c) = Z(u,(a+c)/2,c), <i>(a+c)/2 < u</i></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER><P>

where f(u,a,c) corresponds to the grade of membership of u in the set f, with limits a and c,
where a < c.<P>
For the linguistic actions independent of physical domain the fuzzy functions "Gamma", "L"
and "A" were implemented.  Mathematically these are:<P>

<CENTER><TABLE>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
	<TD>Gamma function:</TD>
	<TD>Gamma(u,a,c) = 0, <i>u < a</i><BR>
		Gamma(u,a,c) = (u-a)/(c-a), <i>a < u < c</i><BR>
		Gamma(u,a,c) = 1, <i>u > c</i></TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD>L function:</TD><TD>1 - Gamma(u,a,c)</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
	<TD>A function:</TD><TD>A(u,a,b,c) = 0, <i>u < a</i><BR>
		A(u,a,b,c) = (u-a)/(b-a), <i>a < u < b</i><BR>
		A(u,a,b,c) = (c-u)/(c-b), <i>b < u < c</i><BR>
		A(u,a,b,c) = 0, <i>u > c</i></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER><P>

where f(u,a,c) corresponds to the grade of membership of u in the set f, with limits a and c,
where a < c and a < b < c.<P>

<P><B><A NAME="InferenceTechniques">1.2 Inference Techniques</A></B><P>
A common use of linguistic variables is in fuzzy rules of the form,<P>
<P><PRE><FONT FACE="TIMES">	if A then C</FONT FACE></PRE>
<P><PRE><FONT FACE="TIMES">	if A and B then C</FONT FACE></PRE><P>
The first form is called a simple rule since it has only one antecedent and only one consequent. 
The second form is a "complex" rule and has multiple antecedents.  The second form also uses
the "and" operation.  Complex rules can employ other operation, such as "or", but the rules in
this projects' rule base use only the "and" operation, which gives the intersection of sets A
and B (implemented as min).<P>
To evaluate if a rule is true to some degree, the intersection between fact and the antecedent is
found.  If we call this value z, the conclusion set can either be clipped of at z (max-min) or have
its membership values scaled by z (max-prod).  This project implements max-prod.<P>
When multiple rules are given together, they form a rule base.  The size of this rule base
depends on the number of fuzzy variables and comparisons that must be made between them. 
This project has two fuzzy variables consisting of three fuzzy sets each, and thus requires 8
control rules.<P>
The process of fuzzy inference is to evaluate each rule in the rule base and determine the level
to which it is applicable.  The outcome of the fuzzy inference process is a fuzzy set, specifying
the fuzzy distribution of a conclusion.<P>

<B><A NAME="Defuzzification">1.3 Defuzzification</A></B><P>
In control applications, only a single discrete action may be taken, so a single point that
reflects the best value of the set needs to be selected.  This process of reducing a fuzzy set to
a single point is know as defuzzification.<P>
The two most common ways of defuzzifying a fuzzy set are center of gravity (cog) and mean of
maxima (mom).  The center of gravity method tries to find the center of gravity of the entire
fuzzy set and produces smoothly varying control output.  The mean of maxima method
concentrates on the values where distribution reaches a maximum and produces less smooth
control output, but is much faster since it is based on compares rather than calculations.  The
mean of maxima method of defuzzification was chosen for this project.<P>
The mean of maxima method returns the x coordinate at which the maximum membership value
of the set is reached.  If the maximum membership occurs at more than one x coordinate, the
average of these x positions is returned.  This method can be given formally as:<P>

<CENTER><TABLE><TR><TD>x' =</TD><TD><IMG SRC=sum.bw.gif ALT="SUM (j=1,J)"></TD><TD> x''j/J</TD>
</TR></TABLE></CENTER>

<P>where x''j are x coordinates of all the maxima and J is the total number of maxima.

<P><B><A NAME="Problem">2.0 Problem Statement</A></B><P>
The goal of this project was to build a fuzzy logic water temperature and flow controller which
could be used in showers and sinks to maintain a "warm" water temperature with "normal"
flow.  This kind of control application lends itself to fuzzy reasoning, since the goals are fuzzy;
there is no exact definition of where warm temperatures and normal flows begin and end.  Thus
the control actions taken to achieve this condition also fuzzy.<P>
The physical situation can be described as follows:<P>
<UL>
<LI>The water is drawn from two sources, hot and cold inlet pipes.
<LI>The amount of water (flow) is controlled by the hot and cold valves.
<LI>The hot and cold water mix at the facet or shower head.
The following assumptions are made:
<LI>The total flow out of the facet or shower head is equal to the flow of the cold
water plus the flow of the hot water.
<LI>Any change in the valve position immediately affects the flow.
<LI>The cold and hot water mix perfectly
<LI>The inlet temperatures/pressures are constant
<LI>Setting the valves to high positions (mostly open) will have less of an effect
than setting the valve to lower positions due to the effect of pressures
(reflected by a scaling factor).
</UL>
The following equations govern the system:<P>
<CENTER><TABLE>
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
	<TD>Fc = VcPc </TD>
	<TD>Fc = Cold Flow<BR>
		Vc = Cold Valve Position<BR>
		Pc = Cold Inlet Pressure</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
	<TD>Fh = VhPh </TD>
	<TD>Fh = Hot Flow<BR>

</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER><P>
where the valve positions (Vc and Vh) are in the domain [0,1].
<P>Graphically the situation can be thought of as:

<B><P><A NAME="Variables">2.1 Linguistic Variables Employed</A></B><P>
Linguistic Variables were created to describe the concept of output Temperature and output
Flow.  These were called outTemp and outFlow.  Also, two linguistic variables corresponding to
the control actions for the hot and cold valve created.  These were called hot_valve_control
and cold_valve_control.<P>

The output Temperature fuzzy variable, outTemp, was described by three fuzzy sets
corresponding to the notions of cold, warm and hot.  The output Flow fuzzy variable, outFlow
was described by three fuzzy sets corresponding to the concepts of low, normal and strong 
<A HREF="cs294.report.html#endnote4">[4]</A>.<P>

The fuzzy variables, outTemp and outFlow, can take either symmetric or asymmetric forms
 <A HREF="cs294.report.html#endnote5">[5]</A>, generic constructors provide this functionality.  
The symmetric forms are:<P>

<CENTER><TABLE>
<TR><TD><IMG SRC=outTemp.bw.gif ALT="outTemp"></TD></TR>
<TR><TD><IMG SRC=outFlow.bw.gif ALT="outFlow"></TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER><P>

The linguistic variables representing the valve control actions have been implemented in both
the normal [-1,1] and standard domains [-6,6].  The fuzzy function "L" was used to describe a
NB motion, the fuzzy function "Gamma" was used to describe a PB motion, while all other
motions were described by the fuzzy function "A".  In the standard domain the valve control
fuzzy variable looks like:<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC=valveControl.bw.gif ALT="valveControl"></CENTER>

<B><A NAME="RuleBase">2.2 Rule Base</A></B><P>
Eight fuzzy if-then rules are used in the rule base to determine the control action depending on
the current temperature and flow.  These rules are:<P>
<OL>
<LI>If temperature is <U>cold</U> and <U>flow</U> is low <BR>then

</OL>

<B><A NAME="Implementation">2.3 Other Implementation Details</A></B><P>
The fuzzy water temperature and flow controller was implemented using the Java language. 
Java allowed for the greatest flexibility in program design and portability.<P>

First of all, java is object oriented, allowing for each part of the program to be treated as a
object with certain attributes or characteristics.  This is a intuitive way of thinking about
fuzzy variables.  For example, the fuzzy variable outTemp has the characteristics cold, warm
and hot (see file <A HREF="outTemp.java" TARGET=mainframe>outTemp.java</A>).  The object oriented 
nature also allows for these attributes to be changed easily.  For example, if the description of 
warm needed to be changed from a "PI" function to "A" function, a simple declaration change will 
achieve the effect.<P>

Second, java has a clear inheritance structure, which made writing descriptions of fuzzy
functions simple.  Each fuzzy function was subclassed from a generic description of all possible
fuzzy functions (see file 
<A HREF="genericFuzzyFunction.java" TARGET=mainframe>genericFuzzyFunction.java</A>) 
allowing all rule references and related calculations to be written in general 
(see file <A HREF="ruleBase.java" TARGET=mainframe>ruleBase.java</A>).  Thus changing 
fuzzy functions description would not change the method for calculating min-max, max-prod, etc.<P>

Third, java has a straight forward package system, which allowed different parts of the
project to be grouped together.  For example, all fuzzy function were placed in the package
cs294pkg.fuzzyfunctions, while all fuzzy variables were placed in the package
cs294.fuzzyvars.<P>

Fourth, java supports native GUI methods, which made it easy to provide a gui interface for
testing the system.<P>

Finally, JDK 1.0.2 is available for free from java.sun.com, and it provided a consistent
development environment on my Macintosh at home and the Unix platforms at school.<P>

<B><A NAME="Results">3.0 Results and Conclusions</A></B><P>
The system was tested in several conditions.  Two goal temperatures and flows were tested
for.  These were 30 C and 12 liters/min and 36 C and 15 liters/min.  The tests were conducted
for both simple delta and simple position.  Simple delta meant that the defuzzified control action
was interpreted as a delta position to move to from the current valve position, while simple
position meant that the defuzzified control action was interpreted as the position to move the
valve to.  The tests were conducted from initial off, both valves half way open and both valves
fully open.  The number of iterations that the system required to achieve the goal temperature,
thus lower numbers are better.<P>

Graphing these results,<P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC=results.bw.gif ALT="Results"></CENTER><P>

This leads to the conclusion that fuzzy control is effective in most cases involving the simple
delta interpretation for the defuzzified control output.  On average the system required 2.3
iterations to achieve control in the simple delta interpretation, whereas the system required an
average of 10.5 iterations in the simple position interpretation.<P>

<B><A NAME="FutureWork">3.1 Future Work</A></B><P>
There are several improvements to this system that can be made.  First of all the fuzzy
variable for temperature could be extended to include the concepts of cold, cool, comfortable,
warm and hot, while the fuzzy variable for flow could be extended to include the concepts of
weak, low, normal, powerful and strong.  Increasing the granularity of the fuzzy variables
corresponding to temperature and flow will result in more rules and in greater precision in
formulating control responses.<P>
Second, the defuzzification method could be changed to the center of gravity method from the
mean of maxima method.  This will allow for smoothly varying control output and will possible
avoid the problems of control loss where the controller flips between too high and too low
setting.  Implementing the center of gravity method would also require a generic trapezoidal
fuzzy function to be implemented.<P>
Third, many more test cases could be run, including test cases for:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Cold Valve off, Hot Valve partially open<BR>
<LI>Cold Valve off, Hot valve fully open<BR>
<LI>Cold Valve partially open, Hot Valve off<BR>
<LI>Cold Valve partially open, Hot Valve fully open<BR>
<LI>Cold Valve fully open, Hot Valve Off<BR>
<LI>Cold Valve fully open, Hot Valve partially open<P>
</UL>
Running these tests will allow for a better understanding in which situation fuzzy control is
effective, and in which situations improvements can be made.<P>
