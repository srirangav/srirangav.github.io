<P><B>One-dimensional Polymers<BR>
</B>One dimensional polymers are most common. They can occur whenever 2
reacting chains join to make a chain. If the long-chains pack regularly,
side-by-side, they tend to form crystalline polymers. If the long chain
molecules are irregularly tangled, the polymer is amorphous since there
is no long range order. Sometimes this type of polymer is called glassy.</P>

<P> <B>Two-dimensional Polymers<BR>
</B>Two dimensional polymers are rare, the best example of one would be
graphite. It is the structure of graphite which provides its great lubricating
capability. The condition to form this planar structure is to have 3 or
more active groups all directed in the same plane and capable of forming
a planar network. This structure offers low shear strength and good lubricating
properties.</P>

<P> <B>Three-dimensional Polymers<BR>
</B>Crystalline Diamond is an example of the 3-dimensional crystalline
polymer in which carbon is linked to four corners of the tetrahedra and
these are packed with long range order in space to form a lattice. Diamond
has properties which are much more like ceramics than polymers in terms
of mechanical behavior (high melting point, modulus, hardness, strength,
and fracture behavior) because of this.</P>
