In step growth polymerization or condensation polymerization, chains
of any lenght x and y combine to form long chains:<BR>
</P>
<P><CENTER>x-mer + y-mer --&gt; (x + y)-mer</CENTER></P>
<P>Synthetic step growth polymers have been around since the late 1920s.
The term condensation polymerization comes from this time period, because
the early reaction yielded water. More recently it has been found that
several other polymer reaction will condense out products such as HCl or
will condense out no products.</P>
<P>Step growth polymerization is used to yield branched as well as networked
polymers. The true initator of a network structure lines in a multifunctional
monomer. As the length and frequency of branches on the polymer chain increases
so does the probability that the branches will reach from chain to chain.
When all the chains are connected together the entire polymer mass becomes
one giant molecule. Consider a bowling ball, it has a molecular weight
on the order of 10**27 g/mol, and it is one giant molecule. Crosslinked
or network polymers form in one of two ways: </P>

<TD><B>Chain Growth<BR>
</B>Chain growth polymerization involves an active chain site which reacts
wiht an unsatureated (or heterocyclic) monomer such that the active site
is recovered at the chain end. Vinyl polymers were probably the first to
be synthesized in this manner when in 1839 Simon reported the conversion
of styrene to some gealtinous mass. In general, high molecular weight species
are made by the successive addtion of new monomers to the chain end. There
are several different techniques of synthesis depending on the active site.
These are:
